# Gradle 4 Exercises

This is a set of simple exercises for the Entelect 2018 Bootcamp, designed to
give you a light introduction to Gradle. Since the bulk of the time you spend
in Bootcamp will be spent using Maven, this is just intended to broaden your
experience a bit (it might come in handy if you end up working on an Android
project).

As prerequisite to starting these exercises you will need to ensure that you
have:

 * JDK 8 installed and available on the PATH.
 * Gradle installed and available on the PATH (https://gradle.org/install/). 

To start the exercise check out branch `exercise1` and check back here for
instructions.
